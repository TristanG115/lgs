# LGS (Little Grad Student)

LGS is a VS Code extension that will eventually orchestrate reliable software-engineering agents. Phase 1 adds provider-neutral model backends and real streaming chat. It intentionally does not add agent tools.

## Repository structure

- `src/extension.ts` — extension-host activation, command, and `WebviewViewProvider`.
- `src/webview/` — browser-side UI and styles.
- `src/shared/messages.ts` — typed message contracts and runtime validation shared by both sides.
- `src/shared/logger.ts` — small extension logging abstraction.
- `test/` — Vitest tests for shared utilities.
- `esbuild.mjs` — extension and webview build entry points.

## Installation and development

Install dependencies with `npm install`, then use `npm run build` for a production build. `npm run dev` watches both entry points. Quality checks are `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, and `npm test`.

To launch the extension, open this repository in VS Code and press `F5`. This opens an Extension Development Host. Select the LGS activity-bar icon, enter a message, and press **Send**.

## Model backend architecture

`ModelBackend` exposes backend identity, connection state, capabilities, model discovery, cancellable streaming chat, normalized usage, and structured errors. `LgsMessage` contains a role and an array of text or image content parts. Stream output is represented by `StreamEvent` values (`textDelta`, `usage`, `done`, and `error`).

The lifecycle is: construct a backend, discover models, select a model, call `streamChat` with an `AbortSignal`, consume events, and abort when the user presses Stop. Ollama uses its native NDJSON API; `OpenAICompatibleBackend` uses `/models` and `/chat/completions`, supporting LM Studio, llama.cpp, vLLM, and similar servers; `AnthropicBackend` uses the Messages API. Provider-specific wire schemas are confined to `src/model/`.

API secrets are retrieved from VS Code `SecretStorage`. They are never placed in settings, project files, logs, or chat history. To add a provider, implement `ModelBackend`, translate its protocol into normalized `ModelInfo` and `StreamEvent` values, and register it in `src/model/registry.ts`.

## Communication architecture

The webview posts only the `ClientMessage` union. The extension host receives `unknown`, validates it with `parseClientMessage`, and responds only with the `HostMessage` union. The webview validates incoming events with `isHostMessage` before rendering them. The Phase 0 response is canned; model calls are deliberately deferred.
